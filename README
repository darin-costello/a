This displays a gui used in conjunction with Kris_alder_algo. It will display the locations received from /april_tag_pos. The blue circles are the robots the black squares are obstacles. By clicking on a robot the robot is put into leader mode. Subsequence clicks not on the robot will tell the leader to move to that location.
By clicking on the same robot again it will switch back to surround mode. Clicking on a different robot will make the second robot the leader the old leader then switches to follow mode.
